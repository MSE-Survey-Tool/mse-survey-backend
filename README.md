## MSE Survey Tool - Backend

This project contains a **survey tool** for our university department.

The main advantages over other survey tools are:
* We have complete control over the data
* We included an email verification so that actually only people 
  from out university can take part in a survey
* We have complete control over the design
* we can easily run it on any environment with any domain we like
