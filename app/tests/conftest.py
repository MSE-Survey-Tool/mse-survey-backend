    Normally, pytest-asyncio would create a new loop for each test case,
    probably with the intention of not sharing resources between tests, as
    is best practice. In our case we would thus need to recreate the motor
    client and all surveys (as they depend on the motor client) for each
    test case. This severly slows the testing, which is why we in this case
    deviate from the best practice and use a single event loop for all our
    test cases.
